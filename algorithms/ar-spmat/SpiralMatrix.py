    Spiral Matrix implementations.


    The spiral matrix algorithm takes a 2-Dimensional array of N-rows and M-columns as an input, and orders the
    elements of this matrix in spiral order.

    Example:
    [1 , 2, 3]
    [4 , 5, 6]
    [7 , 8, 9]

    is printed out in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5

    :list matrix: 2-Dimensional Array
    :return: List ordered in spiral order
    :rtype: list
